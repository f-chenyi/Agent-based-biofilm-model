\f0\fs24 \cf0 Guide to biofilm simulation framework.\
\
This C++ program uses the GSL numerical integration algorithm to simulate growing and dividing, soft, sticky spherocylinders, which are a useful model system for bacteria that form biofilms. For a rigorous definition of the model, see my paper.\
\
Instructions to run the program:\
\
1. Type \'93make\'94 to compile\
2. Type "./simulate [index] [Lf] [E_1] [NU_1]\'94,\
\
where [Lf] is the cell cylinder division length, E_1 is the stiffness of cell-substrate contact, and NU_1 is the surface drag coefficient, e.g.\
\
\'93./simulate 1 50 1 1\'94\
\
The program outputs the configuration of the system at regular intervals into the folder \'93output\'94 with the following format:\
\
[time] [number of cells]\
[cell 1 x] [cell 1 y] [cell 1 z] [cell 1 nx] [cell 1 ny] [cell 1 nz] [cell 1 length] [cell 1 growth rate] [cell 1 in contact with cell 2?] [total surface force] [net force in x] [net force in y] [cell lineage]\
